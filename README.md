🚦 Intelligent Traffic Management System
Overview
An AI-powered traffic management system that dynamically adjusts traffic signals based on real-time vehicle density analysis using YOLOv8 and OpenCV.

🚀 Features
✅ Real-time vehicle detection using YOLOv8
✅ Dynamic signal control based on traffic density
✅ Live dashboard to visualize traffic conditions
✅ Image uploads for monitoring intersections
✅ Optimized traffic flow with adaptive timing

🛠️ Technologies Used
1️⃣ Image Processing & Detection
YOLOv8 – Vehicle detection

OpenCV – Image processing

2️⃣ Backend Processing
Flask & Python – Real-time request handling

NumPy & Pandas – Data analysis

3️⃣ Traffic Signal Logic
Vehicle density analysis

Dynamic signal timing adjustments

4️⃣ Frontend & UI
HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript – Interactive UI

AJAX & Bootstrap – Real-time updates

5️⃣ Data Management
MySQL / MongoDB – Storing traffic data

Flask Sessions – Live monitoring

🛠️ Installation & Setup
🔹 Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Application
python app.py


📌 How It Works
1️⃣ Upload intersection images → 2️⃣ Detect vehicles → 3️⃣ Analyze traffic density → 4️⃣ Adjust signal timings dynamically

💡 Future Enhancements
